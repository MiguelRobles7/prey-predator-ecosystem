# Prey-Predator Ecosystem

Learning Activity using NetLogo for CMPLXSY (Complex Systems) class at De La Salle University.

## Description

A basic hawks and rabbits prey predator system with adjustable parameters to create a rough simulation of such actions. The turtles move randomly on the map. Every tick, a hawk eats one rabbit nearby if there are any, and a rabbit eats grass in the patch it is on if there are any. Every tick there is also a chance for both hawks and rabbits to reproduce. This continues until either side is completely depleted.

## Adjustable Parameters

-   Initial Hawk & Rabbit Population
-   Grass Regrowth Time
-   Hawks & Rabbits Energy Gain on Eating
-   Hawks & Rabbits Chance to Reproduce
-   Hawks & Rabbits Movement Configurations

## Project Setup

Go to `Tools` > `Turtle Shapes Editor` > `Import from Library` from there you should be able to find the Hawk and Rabbit model.

## Running the Project

Simply press the `setup` and then the `go` button.
